BillUp is a calculator for doctors and advance practitioners to determine complexity of medical decision making, and thereby level of service, for each patient encounter. This can be used to ensure robust documentation in the patient chart, allowing you to confidently bill at the appropriate level.

BillUp is available from the App Store for iPhone.
